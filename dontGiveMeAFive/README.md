# Description 

## Don't give me five!

In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!

Examples:

1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8

The result may contain fives. 

The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both numbers can be also negative!
