Playing around and doing some katas with Test Driven Development.

## To get started

Run the following command inside the funKatas folder:

```
npm install
```

To run the tests for ALL the fileName.test.js files run the following command:

```
npm test
```

To run the tests for a specific file run the following command:

```
npm test -- fileName.test.js
```

An example of the command above could be:

```

## Make Commands

You can also use 'make' commands:

Run a specific test file:

```

Generate documentation using JSDoc:

Open the generated documentation in your browser:

```
