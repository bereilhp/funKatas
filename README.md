Playing around and doing some katas with TDD.


## To get started

Run the following command inside the funKatas folder:

```
npm install
````

To run the tests for ALL the fileName.test.js files run the following command:

````
npm test
````

To run the tests for a specific file run the following command:

````
npm test -- fileName.test.js
````

An example of the command above could be: 

````
npm test -- messi.test.js
````

You can also change the makefile and write the command above and just run 
````
make test
````
