# Rules 

Write a function that takes a positive number(always) as an input and returns:
- For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number
- For the multiples of five print Buzz instead of the number
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz instead of the number
- For numbers which are not multiples of three and/or five print the number
